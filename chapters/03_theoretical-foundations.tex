\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}\label{chapter:theoreticalFoundacions}

In this chapter, we investigate the theoretical foundations by examining database performance measurements and in the next step describing used datasets and the data structure.\\We will start by discussing the characterisitcs of database systems and elaborate on the significance of performance measurements in this context. Additionally, we will outline the common performance metrics, that play a central role in the evaluation of performance analysis.
\\ For clarifying used datasets and the data structure, we commence by describing the utilized performance data, followed by giving an overview of the structure of the Benchy Viewer's input file containing the performance measurements. Moreover, the data prepration for this input file will be explained.

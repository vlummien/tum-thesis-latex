A settings icon button in the sidebar provides direct access to the global settings of the Benchy Viewer, allowing users to adjust application-wide settings from anywhere within the application.



\subsubsection{Header}
The header, along with the sidebar, remains visible in all scenarios within the Benchy Viewer. While the sidebar offers a range of functionalities, the header contains fewer elements. The central element of the header is the legend, strategically placed to eliminate the need for a legend in each individual visualisation, promoting a clean and efficient overview. Users can activate or deactivate any system at any time using the toggles within the legend.

Another crucial functionality in the header is the selection of the baseline system and the focused query, offering the same advantage of accessibility at any point in the user's workflow.

Additionally, the header adapts contextually when navigating to the "Query Plan" page. In this scenario, a slider appears for selecting the comparison strategy between query plans, providing further flexibility and control, as explored in Section \ref{sec:semantic-diff-integration}.



\subsubsection{Pages}

The Sidebar and Header form the foundation of the user interface, while the remaining space is dedicated to displaying the various pages. Essentially, the Benchy Viewer comprises three main pages, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:pages}: the Analytics Dashboard page, the Query Plan page, and the Input File Viewer page.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Project Structure Hierarchy}
  \label{fig:project-structure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Root Component}
The root component is the entry point of the Benchy Viewer React application, orchestrating critical processes that define its robustness and efficiency.\\
The primary responsibility of the root component is to render the main application, serving as the nexus for various functionalities, providing the structural and organizational backbone for the entire application. 

In the project structure hierarchy, the root component encapsulates the application with\texttt{ <React.StrictMode/>}~\parencite{reactstrictmode}, which is a tool that highlights common issues and potential problems in a React application during development.
In general, it detects impure calculations in the context of component states and multiple rendering. It enables a set of additional checks and warnings to catch and alert developers about unsafe or deprecated practices, contributing to better code quality. While it doesn't affect the production build, it's a valuable aid in identifying and addressing issues early in the development phase.


\subsubsection{State Management with Redux}
The Redux Provider in the Benchy Viewer, built using the Redux~Framework~\parencite{Redux}, serves as the central hub for managing the application's state. It acts as a shared space where different parts of the application can store and retrieve data efficiently.\\
Utilizing the capabilities of \textit{Redux Toolkit}\parencite{redux-toolkit}, the Redux Provider supplies the global state across the entire application. This global state is compartmentalized into five distinct slices, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:global-state}, each serving a unique purpose.

  \label{fig:global-state}
\end{figure}

% Analytics Dashboard state
The Analytics Dashboard State encapsulates all the data concerning visualizations within the Analytics Dashboard. It includes information about the position within the dashboard and the configuration of each visualization element. A more detailed exploration of this data structure is provided in Section \ref{sec:analytics-dashboard}.

% Imported Benchmark Data state
The Current Benchmark Data State is responsible for holding all benchmark data from various database systems. This state is a pivotal component used across the Analytics Dashboard, Query Plan View, and Benchmark Data View. A detailed examination of this state's structure is available in Section \ref{sec:input-data}.

% Global Settings state
Focused on interactive features within visualizations, the Global Settings State encompasses functionalities like the global hover state or the selected query. Section \ref{sec:global-settings} delves into the specifics of this data structure.

% Query Plan Parameters state
Tailoring the visualization needs for the user, the Query Plan Parameters State contains data related to the appearance and comparison types of the query plans. More insights into this state are provided in Section \ref{sec:query-plan-parameters}.

% Query Plan Nodes state
Lastly, the Query Plan Nodes State unfolds the story of the actual query plan, housing details about every node and their associated information. For a comprehensive exploration, turn to Section \ref{sec:query-plan-structure}.


\subsubsection{Router}
Navigating through the corridors of the Benchy Viewer's project structure, the router, powered by \textit{React Router} \parencite{react-router}, providing a standardized approach to handle navigation in React. Specifically, in our application, this router guides users through three key areas: the Analytics Dashboard, Query Plan View, and Data Viewer.
